# The Silver Bird: The Many

# Chapter 1: The Aftermath

In the days following Prethy’s death, Neah was a shell of herself. The grief weighed heavily on her, far more than she had anticipated. Every night, she replayed the moment in the aviary—the final screech, the dimming of Prethy’s red eyes, and the painful silence that followed. She had killed her beloved companion, her friend, but it had been necessary. Prethy had been lost to the darkness, twisted by Thena’s greed for power. Still, that knowledge did little to ease the ache in Neah’s heart.

The authorities had arrested Thena shortly after the confrontation. Neah had provided them with enough evidence of her illegal activities, including the trafficking of rare and mystical creatures. Though Thena had scoffed and sneered during her arrest, claiming that no prison could hold her, Neah had seen the flicker of fear in her eyes. For now, at least, the danger seemed to be over. Thena was behind bars, and Prethy’s torment was finally at an end.

But something gnawed at Neah. In the back of her mind, a sense of unfinished business lingered. She tried to focus on her work at the vet clinic, helping sick animals and reconnecting with her sisters, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that something dark was still at play. It didn’t help that every night, the same dream haunted her: Prethy, with her eyes glowing red, rising from the dead, chasing her through endless corridors of darkness.

It was during one of these restless nights that the nightmares became a reality.

Neah was at home, preparing to close her curtains for the evening, when a strange sound echoed from outside.

# Chapter 2: The Reveal

It was a low, guttural cooing sound, a noise she had once found comforting. Her heart stopped. That sound—it couldn’t be. Slowly, she stepped out onto her porch, the cool night air prickling her skin. She looked around, scanning the darkened yard for any sign of movement. For a moment, everything was still.

Then she saw it. A shadow, large and feathered, moving silently across the yard. Her breath caught in her throat as the figure stepped into the pale light of the moon.

It was Prethy.

But not the Prethy she had once loved. This creature, though it bore her familiar silver feathers, looked different—larger, more menacing. Its eyes, now glowing a deep, unnatural red, locked onto her, and Neah felt the air leave her lungs.

“No,” she whispered, stumbling back. “You’re dead. I killed you.”

The bird let out a screech, its voice echoing through the night, and lunged toward her. Neah barely had time to slam the door shut before Prethy’s talons scraped against the wood. Panting, she backed away, her mind racing. This wasn’t possible. She had put Prethy to rest. What was this? Some kind of sick resurrection?

The house fell into silence, but Neah knew better than to believe the threat had passed. Prethy was back, but how? And why?

The answer came to her in a flash—Thena. Somehow, she had to be behind this. Even from jail, she was orchestrating this nightmare. The woman’s greed for power knew no bounds.

# Chapter 3: The Targeting

Over the next few days, Prethy’s attacks became more frequent, each one more vicious than the last. Neah found herself constantly on edge, looking over her shoulder, never knowing when the bird might strike next. It was a game of cat and mouse, a cruel chase in which Neah was always one step behind, barely escaping Prethy’s deadly attacks.

But Neah wasn’t the only one being targeted. As the days passed, she learned that Prethy wasn’t alone. The bird’s children—three unnamed chicks that Neah had never seen—had also risen. These offspring, like their mother, had been corrupted by the same dark energy that had taken Prethy. They were smaller, but no less dangerous, and together, they formed a deadly flock, hunting Neah at every turn.

Desperate for answers, Neah reached out to her sisters for help. Riya, ever the researcher, uncovered an ancient text that spoke of a ritual capable of bringing mystical creatures back from the dead. It was a dark, forbidden magic, one that Thena had likely used. But there was hope. The text also mentioned that the bond between a creature and its offspring was the key to ending the cycle of resurrection. If one of Prethy’s children could break free from the corruption, it could end Prethy’s reign of terror forever.

# Chapter 4: The Hope

And so, Neah sought out Pithurby, the youngest of Prethy’s children. Unlike the others, Pithurby had always been more curious, more in tune with the world around her. Neah believed that if any of the offspring could be saved, it was her.

The final confrontation came one stormy night. Prethy and her children had tracked Neah to the old aviary, the place where it had all begun. The rain pounded against the roof as Neah stood in the center of the room, holding the ancient text in one hand and a small talisman in the other. She could hear the screeches of the birds circling overhead, waiting for the right moment to strike.

Suddenly, the roof collapsed as Prethy and her children descended. The battle was brutal. Neah fought with everything she had, using traps and the knowledge she had gained from years of working with animals to outmaneuver the birds. But it was Pithurby who made the difference.

In the heat of the battle, Neah held out the talisman, calling to Pithurby. “I know you’re still in there,” she shouted over the chaos. “I know you’re not like the others. You don’t have to be.”

For a moment, Pithurby hesitated, her red eyes flickering as if struggling against the darkness within. Then, with a heart-wrenching screech, she turned on Prethy.

The battle between mother and daughter was swift and brutal. Pithurby, driven by something deep within her, struck the final blow, her beak piercing Prethy’s heart. Prethy let out one final, ear-splitting screech before collapsing to the ground, her body disintegrating into a cloud of silver dust. The other three chicks, seeing their mother fall, fled into the night, never to be seen again.

# Chapter 5: The Horror

The aftermath was silent. Neah stood in the center of the ruined aviary, rain pouring through the gaping hole in the roof, her heart heavy. Prethy was gone, this time for good. But the victory felt hollow. Too much had been lost.

The authorities quickly came for Thena. Armed with the knowledge that she had orchestrated Prethy’s resurrection, Neah had provided them with enough evidence to lock Thena away for life. As they dragged her away, Thena spat venomous threats at Neah, her eyes burning with rage. “You think you’ve won, but this isn’t over,” she snarled. “You’ll never stop what’s coming.”

Neah ignored her, watching as the police car drove away, taking Thena to the maximum-security prison where she would spend the rest of her days.

But the sense of unease never left her.

Weeks passed, and life slowly returned to normal. Neah focused on her work, trying to forget the horrors of the past few months. But late at night, the nightmares continued. And then, one evening, she received a chilling message.

# Chapter X

Thena had a daughter, someone named Threnadi.

The message came with a picture—Threnadi, standing in front of a large, ominous machine. Neah’s heart stopped as she recognized the figure inside the machine. It was Prethy.

Threnadi stared at the machine, her expression cold and calculating. Slowly, she placed her hand on the glass, watching as the machine hummed to life, generating a clone of Prethy, her feathers once again shimmering with silver light.

Threnadi smiled to herself, her voice barely a whisper. "The game is over, but only when I say it’s over."
