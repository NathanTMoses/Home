# The Silver Bird: The Battle

## Chapter 1: The Calm

The screech that echoed through the cavernous room sent a shockwave through the air, and for a brief, heart-stopping moment, everything went still. Neah could feel the thundering pulse in her neck as her eyes locked onto the noble bird. It stood tall, unwavering in the chaos, feathers gleaming like molten silver, a creature born of grace and power. The clones, once ravenous and relentless, froze in place, their crimson eyes flickering as if unsure of how to proceed.

Neah's back was still against the cold, rusted wall of the abandoned factory, her chest heaving with exhaustion. Her arms ached from firing the Khostov rifle relentlessly, and her body trembled with adrenaline. Her weapon was spent—useless now. If not for this bird’s sudden intervention, she would already be dead.

The clones hesitated, their collective screeching falling into an eerie silence, broken only by the faint rustle of feathers. Neah kept her eyes on the noble bird, a glimmer of hope igniting in her chest. There was something deeply familiar about the way it moved, the way it carried itself with a quiet dignity. She couldn’t place it yet, but instinctively, she knew this bird was different.

As the noble bird stepped forward, the clones shifted, their talons scraping against the concrete as they adjusted their positions. The air grew thick with tension. Neah could sense that this battle wasn’t over, not by a long shot. The clones’ bloodlust had only been momentarily paused, not erased.

Then, in a flurry of feathers, it began again.

## Chapter 2: The Surge

The nearest clone lunged forward, its beak snapping viciously at Neah’s face, but before it could reach her, the noble bird intercepted it with a swift, powerful strike of its talons. The clone let out a hideous screech, tumbling to the ground in a heap of broken feathers. The noble bird was upon it in an instant, delivering the final blow with precision, ending the clone’s life with a snap of its neck.

Neah pushed herself off the wall, feeling her legs wobble beneath her. She needed to move, to stay alive. The clones were regaining their confidence, their hesitation fading as they swarmed around her and the noble bird. With her Khostov out of ammo, Neah had no choice but to rely on her instincts and sheer grit.

The noble bird moved like a silver streak through the dimly lit room, its wings slicing through the air as it tore through the clones with savage elegance. One after another, they fell, their screeches piercing the night as the noble bird dispatched them with deadly precision. Neah, though unarmed, wasn’t defenseless. As a clone darted toward her, she grabbed a length of metal pipe lying discarded on the floor and swung it with all her might, connecting with the clone’s skull. It crumpled to the ground, dazed but not dead.

The fight dragged on, grueling and unrelenting. Neah could feel every second stretch into eternity as the clones came at her from all sides, their talons slashing at her clothes, their beaks snapping inches from her skin. The noble bird moved in tandem with her, taking down clones with an otherworldly grace, their combined efforts thinning the horde but not stopping them entirely.

For every clone they killed, it seemed two more took its place. The factory floor was littered with feathers and the bodies of the fallen, but still, the remaining clones fought on, their eyes burning with unnatural fury.

Neah swung the pipe with reckless abandon, her arms burning with fatigue. She could hear her own ragged breaths, feel the slickness of sweat rolling down her neck. Her muscles screamed for relief, but she couldn’t stop. Not now.

Suddenly, out of the corner of her eye, she saw the noble bird falter for a split second. A clone had managed to latch onto its back, its sharp beak snapping viciously at the noble bird’s wings. With a sharp screech, the bird shook the clone off, throwing it to the ground before delivering a killing blow with its talons. But that brief moment of weakness was enough for Neah to realize something.

This noble bird wasn’t just any bird.

## Chapter 3: The Reality

It was Pithurby.

The realization hit Neah like a punch to the gut. Pithurby had grown up—matured into this noble, powerful creature before her. It all made sense now: the familiarity in the way the bird moved, the unwavering determination in its eyes. This was Prethy’s daughter, the one Neah had saved in the final moments of their last battle.

A surge of emotion flooded Neah’s chest, but there was no time to dwell on it. The fight was still raging, and Pithurby—her Pithurby—was fighting for her life alongside Neah.

Fueled by this newfound revelation, Neah fought harder, swinging the pipe with renewed strength as the clones continued to swarm. Pithurby screeched, a commanding sound that echoed off the walls, and together, they took down clone after clone, their movements synchronized in a deadly dance of survival.

The battle dragged on for what felt like hours, each moment a blur of feathers, blood, and the deafening sound of screeches and gunshots. Slowly but surely, the number of clones began to dwindle. Neah’s body ached, her lungs burning from the effort, but she pressed on, determined to see the fight through to the end.

Eventually, only one clone remained.

## Chapter 4: The Lasting

It stood at the far end of the room, its feathers ruffled and bloodied from the fight. Its eyes, glowing a fierce red, were locked on Neah, filled with hatred and bloodlust. The creature let out a low, guttural screech, its body coiling in preparation to strike.

Neah raised her pipe, but before she could react, the clone lunged at her with blinding speed. She swung the pipe, but it missed, the clone ducking beneath her strike. It crashed into her, knocking her to the ground. Her weapon flew out of her hand, clattering uselessly across the floor.

She was out of bullets. Out of weapons.

Out of options.

## Chapter 5: The Finality

The clone was on top of her now, its talons digging into her shoulders as it screeched in her face. Neah gritted her teeth, her body screaming in pain as she fought against the creature’s overwhelming strength. She reached up, grabbing the clone by the neck and squeezing with everything she had. It thrashed wildly, its beak snapping dangerously close to her face.

With a roar of pure determination, Neah rolled to the side, throwing the clone off her. She scrambled to her feet, but the clone was relentless. It came at her again, its talons slashing at her legs. Neah cried out in pain, but she didn’t stop. She couldn’t.

The clone lunged again, and this time, Neah met it head-on. She grabbed it by the throat, her fingers digging into its feathers as she fought to keep its beak away from her face. The clone screeched, its wings flapping wildly as it struggled to break free. But Neah held on, her muscles trembling with the effort.

With a final, desperate burst of strength, Neah slammed the clone into the ground, pinning it beneath her. She raised her fist and brought it down, again and again, her knuckles cracking against the creature’s skull. Blood splattered across the floor, but Neah didn’t stop until the clone stopped moving.

She stood there, panting, her body shaking from the exertion. The clone was dead.

## Chapter 6: The Victory

But in its final moments, it had managed to lash out one last time. Neah felt a sharp pain in her neck and reached up, her fingers brushing against a deep wound where the clone’s beak had pierced her skin.

She staggered back, her hand slick with blood, but the fight was over. She looked up, and there, standing in front of her, was Pithurby. The noble bird’s eyes were filled with concern as it approached Neah, its feathers gleaming in the faint light.

Neah smiled weakly, her body aching from the fight. “We did it,” she whispered, her voice hoarse. Pithurby let out a soft, almost reassuring screech, and Neah reached out, placing a hand on the bird’s head.

Together, they walked away from the battlefield, leaving behind the broken bodies of the clones. Neah’s heart was heavy with exhaustion, but she felt a sense of peace wash over her as she leaned on Pithurby for support.

As they stepped out of the ruined building, the cool night air brushing against their skin, Neah felt the weight of everything lift off her shoulders.

But then, something strange happened.

## Chapter 7: The Turning

Her vision blurred for a moment, and a sudden heat spread through her veins. She blinked, trying to shake off the feeling, but it didn’t go away. Instead, it intensified.

Pithurby nuzzled against her side, but Neah couldn’t focus. Her thoughts were clouded, her body trembling as an unsettling sensation crept over her.

Then, without warning, Neah’s eyes flashed red.

She stopped in her tracks, a strange smile spreading across her lips.

The fight was over.

But something else had just begun.

# The End
