# The Silver Bird: The Horror

## Chapter 1

The air crackled with tension, thick with anticipation as Neah faced down Whip, the mysterious warrior who had stepped through the portal. His presence was overpowering, the sheer force of his being making the very ground beneath them tremble. Neah’s breath came in ragged gasps, her bloodlust still present, but now laced with a gnawing sense of dread. She knew this was no ordinary fight—this was something far more dangerous.

Whip stood calmly, his sleek black armor gleaming in the dim light. His helmet shielded his face, but his eyes—those piercing golden eyes—were visible, glowing with an unnatural intensity. His weapon, while still sheathed, hummed with raw energy, a deadly reminder of the power he wielded.

But it wasn’t the weapon that concerned Neah. It was the energy swirling around him, a sickly green web of strands, thin but strong, wrapping around his body and stretching out into the air like threads of fate. She could feel it, like invisible tendrils brushing against her skin, pulling at the edges of reality itself.

“Strand,” Whip said, his voice calm and low, cutting through the air like a knife. “You won’t survive it.”

Neah smirked, ignoring the growing sense of doom gnawing at her. “I’ve killed stronger things than you.”

Without hesitation, Neah raised her rifle—the **Khostov 7G-0X**—a vintage but powerful weapon, its barrel still smoking from the earlier fight. She pulled the trigger, unloading a spray of bullets directly at Whip.

But Whip didn’t flinch. Instead, with a simple flick of his wrist, the strands surrounding him shifted, weaving together into a protective barrier. The bullets hit the strands but disintegrated upon contact, reduced to dust before they could even reach him.

“Pathetic,” Whip said, his voice cold, emotionless.

## Chapter 2

Neah growled, charging forward, her rifle now trained on his head. She fired again and again, but Whip dodged each shot effortlessly, his movements precise, calculated. The strands around him began to move more aggressively, extending out like tendrils, searching for their target.

With a roar of frustration, Neah abandoned her rifle and leaped at him, her bare hands ready to tear him apart. But as she lunged, the strands of **Strand** shot out, wrapping around her arms and legs, stopping her mid-air.

“What—!” Neah struggled, but the strands tightened, binding her in place. She could feel them pulling at her, not just physically, but as if they were unraveling her very essence, tugging at the fabric of her being.

“You don’t understand, do you?” Whip said, stepping closer, his voice calm and measured. “Strand is not just a weapon. It is the weave of reality itself. You can’t fight it.”

Neah screamed in fury, her body shaking with effort as she fought against the invisible binds. But Whip merely watched, his golden eyes glowing brighter as he exerted his will over the strands, tightening them around her body.

With a savage snarl, Neah tore free from the strands, her sheer rage and inhuman strength breaking their hold. She swung at Whip with all her might, her fists aimed at his head, but he was too fast. The strands moved with him, deflecting her blows and countering with sharp, lashing strikes.

Each hit from the strands felt like being cut by a thousand blades. Neah screamed in pain, blood dripping from the deep gashes that appeared across her body. But she didn’t stop. She wouldn’t stop.

## Chapter 2

“You’re weak!” Neah spat, lunging at him again, ignoring the blood flowing freely from her wounds.

Whip didn’t respond. Instead, he unleashed the full force of **Strand**, the threads multiplying and wrapping around Neah with terrifying speed. They twisted around her limbs, pulling them in opposite directions with enough force to shatter bone.

A sickening crack echoed through the air as Neah’s right arm was torn from its socket.

She screamed, staggering back, clutching at the bloody stump where her arm had once been. But even with the pain blurring her vision, she kept fighting, using her remaining arm to hurl her rifle at Whip. The gun clanged uselessly against his armor.

“Your defiance is pointless,” Whip said coldly. “You were doomed the moment I stepped through that portal.”

## Chapter 3

Neah’s eyes burned with fury, her once-beautiful face now twisted into a mask of hatred. Blood dripped from her mouth as she bared her teeth at him. She could feel her body breaking, her bones splintering under the relentless assault of the strands, but she refused to give up.

With a guttural roar, she charged at Whip one last time, her body a mangled mess of broken bones and torn flesh. Her vision blurred, but she aimed for his throat, her one good hand reaching for his neck. 

But Whip was faster. He sidestepped her lunge with ease, and with a flick of his wrist, the strands wrapped around her legs and pulled.

With another sickening crack, both of Neah’s legs were torn from her body.

## Chapter 4

She hit the ground hard, blood pooling around her as she lay there, panting, broken but still alive. Her chest heaved, each breath a struggle as her lungs filled with blood. Her vision was fading, the edges going dark as her body began to shut down.

But she wasn’t done yet.

Using her remaining hand, Neah dragged herself across the ground, leaving a trail of blood behind her. Her ribs were shattered, her skull partially caved in from the relentless beating, but she kept moving, her hatred driving her forward.

Whip watched her struggle, his expression unreadable beneath his helmet. The strands still hovered around him, ready to strike, but he made no move to stop her. He was waiting for her to give up.

But Neah never gave up.

## Chapter 5

With her last bit of strength, she raised her head, glaring up at him through blood-soaked eyes. Her body was broken beyond repair, but her spirit was still defiant.

“BOI!” Neah spat, blood bubbling from her lips as she forced the word out.

Whip’s eyes narrowed.

Without a word, he raised his fist and brought it down with all his strength, crushing Neah’s skull in a single, brutal blow.

The sound of bone shattering echoed through the battlefield, and for a moment, everything went still.

Whip stood over Neah’s lifeless body, blood dripping from his armored fist. He looked down at her, and then, to the surprise of no one, he laughed—a cold, emotionless laugh that echoed through the air.

The battle was over.

## Chapter 6

But as Whip turned his attention to Pithurby, he saw that the noble bird was barely clinging to life. Blood poured from her wounds, and her body trembled with each shallow breath. Whip knelt beside her, his expression softening for the first time.

Pithurby looked up at him with her one good eye, her vision blurred by pain and blood loss. “She’s… coming…” Pithurby whispered, her voice barely audible.

Whip nodded, his golden eyes filled with a quiet understanding. “I know.”

With that, Pithurby took her last breath, her body going limp in Whip’s arms. He held her for a moment, his expression unreadable, before gently laying her to rest on the ground.

For a long moment, Whip remained silent, his head bowed in respect for the fallen bird. Then, with a heavy sigh, he stood and began to dig a grave with his bare hands. He worked quickly but carefully, ensuring that Pithurby was given a proper burial, despite the chaos and destruction surrounding them.

Once the grave was dug, Whip placed Pithurby’s body inside and covered her with dirt. He stood over the grave for a moment, his eyes distant, before turning and heading back to his ship.

As he boarded the **WHIPSTREAK**, he glanced back one last time at the battlefield—the place where Neah had fallen, where Pithurby had died. He knew this was only the beginning. The unknown figure Pithurby had warned him about was still out there, and the battle was far from over.

With a determined look in his eyes, Whip powered up his ship and took off, the portal opening once again as he flew through, heading toward the unknown.

## Chapter 7

In a dark, cold chamber far away, a sinister laugh echoed through the halls. The woman standing in the center of the room grinned wickedly as she watched her captive struggle against the chains that bound her.

Prethy, the real Prethy—pure, good, and untouched by the darkness that had corrupted her clones—hung limply from the chains, her feathers matted with blood, her once-bright eyes dull with pain.

The unknown woman walked forward, her smile widening as she reached out to touch Prethy’s beak.

“Look at you,” she sneered. “So weak. So helpless. And yet, you think you can stop what’s coming?”

Prethy looked up at her, her voice barely a whisper. “You won’t win…”

The woman laughed again, a cold, cruel sound that echoed through the chamber.

“Oh, I already have.”
