# The Silver Bird: The Encounter

## Chapter 1

The air was heavy with the quiet of the aftermath, a deceptive calm after the storm of battle that had ravaged the abandoned building. Neah walked with Pithurby by her side, her steps deliberate, her heart seemingly at peace. But beneath the surface, something dark had taken root. The red in Neah's eyes burned like embers, and the strange, unsettling smile that played on her lips twisted further into something unrecognizable.

Pithurby, still limping from the fight with the clones, began to sense something was wrong. She had felt the shift in Neah—seen it, even. Those eyes. They weren’t her Neah’s eyes. Something had taken hold of her. Something dark. Something evil.

As they walked further from the ruins, Neah’s smile grew more malicious, her movements more predatory. Pithurby, sensing the danger, decided she couldn’t wait any longer. She needed help. Before Neah could notice, Pithurby subtly called an unknown figure using her embedded communicator, a barely visible device concealed beneath her feathers. She didn't know if help would come in time, but she had no choice. Neah was no longer Neah.

Suddenly, without warning, Neah turned on her, eyes glowing with malevolence.

"You think you can stop me?" Neah sneered, her voice twisted with a newfound cruelty.

## Chapter 2

Before Pithurby could react, Neah tackled her to the ground with terrifying force. Pithurby let out a screech of surprise and pain, her massive body hitting the dirt with a sickening thud. She tried to defend herself, flailing her wings to push Neah off, but Neah was relentless, fueled by something dark and unnatural.

"HELP!" Pithurby cried, her voice echoing through the night.

Neah grinned, her teeth bared like a predator closing in for the kill. "No one’s coming to save you," she hissed.

The fight began in earnest.

Pithurby thrashed and struggled, her talons swiping at Neah, trying to fend her off, but Neah’s strength was inhuman. With a vicious snarl, Neah grabbed Pithurby’s left wing and twisted it cruelly. The sound of snapping bone echoed through the air, followed by Pithurby’s agonized screech.

“Neah, stop!” Pithurby begged, her voice cracking with pain. 

But Neah was beyond reason. 

## Chapter 3

She yanked harder, ripping Pithurby’s left wing clean off in a horrifying display of strength. Feathers and blood filled the air as Pithurby collapsed to the ground, screaming in agony. Her body trembled, shock and pain overwhelming her senses as Neah stood over her, eyes glowing brighter, a monster wearing her friend's face.

The brutality didn’t stop there. Neah’s hands, slick with Pithurby’s blood, reached for her talons next. Pithurby tried to pull away, but she was too weak, too broken. With a terrifying grin, Neah grabbed her left talon and tore it from Pithurby’s body, the sound of ripping flesh and bone sending a sickening chill through the night.

Pithurby’s vision blurred with pain, her body convulsing as she tried to escape, but Neah wasn’t finished. She took the sharp talon she had ripped off and, with terrifying precision, drove it into Pithurby’s left eye.

Pithurby let out a blood-curdling scream, her vision immediately going dark in that eye. Blood dripped down her face as Neah twisted the talon cruelly, ensuring the damage was irreversible. 

“Neah,” Pithurby sobbed, “why?”

But Neah didn’t answer. She was no longer the friend Pithurby had known. She was something far more sinister.

## Chapter 4

Pithurby felt herself slipping away, the pain and blood loss too much to bear. She was losing. Her body was broken, her spirit crushed. The light in her remaining eye began to fade, hope slipping through her grasp.

Then her phone rang.

The faint sound of the communicator buzzing through the chaos brought Pithurby back to the edge of consciousness. She looked down, barely able to see through the blood and tears clouding her vision. The screen showed a name—the unknown figure she had called earlier. He had answered.

Through the pain, Pithurby forced a smile, blood staining her beak. 

## Chapter 5

“Maybe I can’t stop you, Neah,” she whispered, her voice trembling but filled with a dark satisfaction.

Neah, still hovering over her, paused, her eyes narrowing. “What are you talking about?” she growled, grabbing Pithurby by the throat.

Pithurby coughed, a broken laugh escaping her lips. “But he can.”

Neah froze, her eyes flicking up as the air around them began to shimmer, a strange energy crackling in the atmosphere. The ground trembled beneath their feet, and suddenly, a portal ripped open in the sky above them, swirling with dark energy. From within the vortex, a massive shadow appeared, moving swiftly toward the ground.

Neah stepped back, momentarily thrown off balance. She stared at the portal in disbelief as the figure descended, riding a sleek, black ship that cut through the sky with terrifying speed. The ship was marked with four massive letters in black and red, the paint glinting ominously under the dim moonlight: **WHIP**.

## Chapter 6

The ship landed with a thunderous boom, the ground shaking beneath its weight. As the ramp lowered, a single figure emerged, stepping into the light. He was clad in black armor, sleek and formidable, with red accents glowing faintly along the edges. His helmet covered most of his face, but his eyes—his piercing, red eyes—shone through, radiating a calm, deadly confidence.

Strapped to his back was a massive weapon, unlike anything Neah had ever seen. It gleamed with dark energy, a mix of technology and ancient power, crackling with raw potential. 

The figure strode forward, his movements measured, radiating authority and power with each step.

Neah’s bloodlust faltered for the first time. She backed away, her eyes flicking between the broken Pithurby and the unknown figure approaching them. Something about him felt... unstoppable.

The man stopped a few paces away, his eyes locking onto Neah with an intensity that made her skin crawl. He didn’t speak, but the air around him seemed to hum with power, the very fabric of reality bending to his will.

Pithurby, barely conscious, let out a weak laugh. “Told you… he could stop you.”

Neah snarled, baring her teeth. She raised her fists, preparing for the next battle, but deep down, a sliver of fear had begun to take root. Whoever this was, he wasn’t like the others she had fought. He was something far more dangerous.

The figure unsheathed his weapon in one fluid motion, the blade gleaming in the faint light. He raised it, pointing it directly at Neah, and for the first time in what felt like ages, Neah hesitated.

The endgame had begun.

But the question now was: would it end in her favor?

Neah grinned, her body tensing for the fight of her life. The portal still flickered ominously behind the unknown figure as he took a step forward, ready to face the monster she had become. His fists were clenched, with powerful green strands surrounding him.

The letters on his ship burned brighter in the night: **WHIP**. 

And with a cold, calculated silence, the battle was about to begin. He grappled to the nearest building, and leaped to the ground.

As he leaped, he drew his [weapon](
