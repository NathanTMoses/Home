# The Silver Bird: The Pain

# Chapter 1

Prethy, the real and pure Prethy, hung limply from the chains that bound her wings and legs. Her once-lustrous feathers were now dull and matted, streaked with blood and grime. The chamber where she was imprisoned reeked of damp stone, with only the faintest hint of moonlight filtering through the cracks in the ceiling. Every now and then, the woman standing before her—cloaked in dark robes—would raise a hand, sending surges of painful energy through Prethy’s fragile body, forcing her to endure torment beyond comprehension.

“You’re strong, little bird,” the woman said in a voice both cold and condescending, her hand crackling with dark energy. “I’ll give you that. But your strength is nothing compared to what’s coming.”

Prethy gasped for air, her eyes half-lidded in exhaustion. She had been in this chamber for days, perhaps weeks—it was impossible to tell anymore. The only sounds that broke the silence were the echoes of her own pained breaths and the woman’s taunting whispers.

“I wonder,” the woman mused as she stepped closer, circling Prethy with calculated steps. “Does your precious Neah even remember you? Or has she moved on? Left you to rot here, forgotten and forsaken?”

Prethy’s heart ached at the mention of Neah’s name, but she remained silent. She had to believe that Neah hadn’t forgotten her, that somehow, someway, rescue would come. But as the woman’s cruel laughter filled the chamber once again, Prethy’s hope dimmed.

“Your silence won’t save you,” the woman sneered, raising her hand again. Dark tendrils of energy erupted from her fingers, wrapping around Prethy’s body like a vise. Prethy screamed as the energy coursed through her, every fiber of her being set aflame with excruciating pain.

“You’re going to break,” the woman whispered in Prethy’s ear, her breath cold and sinister. “You’ll break, just like all the others.”

# Chapter 2

Prethy’s vision blurred as the pain threatened to consume her. She wanted to fight, to struggle, but her body was weak, her spirit teetering on the edge of despair.

Suddenly, the woman released her grip, letting Prethy fall limp in her chains. The bird gasped, her chest heaving as she tried to regain control of her breath. She could feel the heat of her own blood trickling down her feathers, pooling on the stone floor below.

But the woman wasn’t done. She leaned in close to Prethy, her hood still obscuring her face in shadow.

“Do you want to know a secret?” she whispered, her voice sickly sweet, almost playful.

Prethy didn’t respond, barely able to stay conscious.

“The reason you’re still alive…” the woman’s voice trailed off, letting the words hang in the air for a moment before continuing, “is because I need you. I need your suffering, your agony. It’s the key to unlocking something far more powerful than you can imagine. Something even your pathetic little Neah can’t stop.”

Prethy weakly raised her head, her eyes filled with defiance despite the pain. “You… won’t win…” she managed to whisper, her voice hoarse.

The woman laughed, a harsh and bitter sound that echoed through the chamber like a death knell.

“Oh, darling, I already have.”

# Chapter 3

Whip tumbled through the endless darkness, his body weightless as the abyss swallowed him whole. His mind raced, trying to make sense of what had just happened. One moment, he had been battling the relentless clones of Prethy, and the next, the ground beneath him had opened up, sending him plummeting into the void.

But this wasn’t just any void. There was something unnatural about it, something suffocating.

His Ghost floated beside him, its light dimmed by the oppressive darkness. “I’m having trouble getting a reading on our surroundings, Whip,” it said, its usually calm voice tinged with concern. “This place… it’s not normal.”

Whip grunted, steadying himself as he reached out with his hands, trying to grasp onto something—anything—that could slow his descent. But the void offered no purchase, no landmarks, no indication of where he was or how far he had fallen.

And then, just as suddenly as the fall had begun, it stopped.

Whip landed hard on a stone floor, his armor clanging against the cold surface. He groaned in pain but quickly pushed himself to his feet, scanning his surroundings.

# Chapter 4

He was in a large, cavernous chamber, the walls lined with strange, pulsing symbols that glowed faintly in the dark. At the far end of the room stood a large, ornate door, its surface etched with the same strange symbols. But what caught Whip’s attention most was the pedestal in the center of the room.

And on that pedestal… lay a small, feathered form.

“Prethy,” Whip whispered, his eyes widening.

But something was wrong. The Prethy lying on the pedestal wasn’t the same Prethy he had fought alongside in the past. This Prethy was… pure. Untouched by the corruption that had plagued the clones. She lay still, her chest rising and falling faintly, as if she were in a deep, unnatural sleep.

Whip stepped forward, cautiously approaching the pedestal. His Ghost hovered beside him, scanning the area.

“I’m detecting faint life signs,” the Ghost said. “But she’s not in good shape.”

Whip reached out, gently placing a hand on Prethy’s head. Her feathers were soft, almost too soft, and as his hand made contact, he felt a strange warmth spread through his arm. It wasn’t the cold, calculating warmth of corruption—it was something else. Something pure.

“She’s alive,” Whip muttered. “But why is she here? Who’s doing this?”

# Chapter 5

As if in response to his question, the ornate door at the far end of the chamber slowly creaked open, revealing a dark figure standing in the doorway.

Whip’s hand instinctively went to his weapon, but he froze when the figure stepped into the light.

It was the woman from before—the one who had taunted him, who had controlled the clones. Her hood still obscured her face, but her presence filled the room with an oppressive darkness that made the air thick and hard to breathe.

“I see you’ve found my little pet,” the woman said, her voice dripping with malice. “But you’re too late, Whip. Far too late.”

Whip narrowed his eyes, stepping between the woman and Prethy. “You’ve done enough,” he growled. “Whatever you’re planning, it ends now.”

The woman laughed, a cold, haunting sound that sent chills down Whip’s spine.

“You think you’re the hero in this story, don’t you?” she said, her tone mocking. “But you’ve only been a pawn, a tool in something much, much bigger than yourself.”

Whip tightened his grip on his weapon. “I don’t care what your plan is. I’ll stop you.”

# Chapter 6

The woman’s smile widened, and for the first time, she reached up and slowly pulled back her hood, revealing her face.

Whip’s breath caught in his throat.

It was her. It was **Thena**.

“You should’ve listened to me the first time, Whip,” Thena said, her eyes glowing with dark energy. “You should’ve taken my offer when you had the chance.”

Whip’s mind raced, piecing together the fragments of their past encounters. Thena had been behind everything—the clones, the corruption, the suffering Prethy had endured. She had been pulling the strings all along.

“I knew you were trouble,” Whip spat, his voice filled with fury. “But I never thought you’d fall this far.”

Thena’s smile faded, replaced by a look of cold, unrelenting hatred.

“Oh, Whip,” she said softly, her voice laced with venom. “You have no idea how far I’m willing to go.”

With a flick of her wrist, the symbols on the walls began to pulse with dark energy, and the ground beneath Whip’s feet rumbled ominously.

“The real game,” Thena whispered, her eyes burning with malice, “is just beginning.”
