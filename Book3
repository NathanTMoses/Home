# The Silver Bird: The Many

## Chapter 1: The Search

The night was dark and unyielding, the moon swallowed by thick clouds that covered the sky in an oppressive shroud. Neah’s car rumbled to a stop outside an abandoned industrial building on the outskirts of town. She had been searching for Threnadi for weeks, ever since the cryptic message revealing the horrifying truth that Thena’s daughter had resurrected Prethy. The thought of Prethy—her Prethy—being cloned and twisted into something evil again sickened Neah to her core.

She had known something like this was coming. Thena’s threat still echoed in her mind, the venomous promise that the game was far from over. Neah wasn’t naïve. Threnadi had picked up where her mother left off, and Neah was determined to stop her before she could unleash even more of Prethy’s clones into the world. She parked a block away, hoping to remain unseen. As she approached the building, rifle slung over her shoulder, she could feel the weight of it all pressing down on her—every nightmare, every sleepless night. The Khostov 7G-0X rifle was the one thing keeping her grounded, its familiar weight offering her a sliver of reassurance. It had been with her through every battle, every fight for survival.

Tonight would be no different.

The old factory loomed ahead of her, its windows shattered, and rusted doors hanging off their hinges. It had been abandoned for years, but the flickering lights inside told a different story. Threnadi was here. Neah could feel it in her bones.

As she crept inside, her boots crunching softly on the broken glass scattered across the floor, Neah’s senses were on high alert. The air was thick with tension, and the faint hum of machinery could be heard in the distance. She tightened her grip on the Khostov and moved deeper into the building, her eyes scanning every shadow for movement.

Suddenly, a soft rustling sound caught her attention. She whipped around, raising the rifle, finger hovering near the trigger. For a moment, there was nothing—just the eerie silence of the building. But then, she heard it again. This time, the sound was louder, closer.

And then she saw them.

## Chapter 2: The Frenzy

Prethy’s clones.

There were dozens of them, emerging from the shadows like ghosts. Their silver feathers gleamed in the dim light, and their red eyes glowed with an unnatural malevolence. These weren’t the playful, curious birds she had once known. These were creatures of darkness, corrupted by Thena’s and now Threnadi’s twisted ambitions.

Neah’s breath caught in her throat as the clones circled her, their movements fluid and predatory. They screeched in unison, a sound that pierced the air like a blade, sending shivers down her spine. She tightened her grip on the Khostov and steeled herself for the fight that was about to unfold.

The first clone lunged at her, its talons outstretched. Neah reacted on instinct, raising the rifle and firing a single shot. The clone crumpled to the ground, but before she could catch her breath, two more took its place. They dove at her from opposite sides, their screeches deafening in the enclosed space.

Neah ducked just in time, the clones’ sharp beaks missing her by inches. She rolled to the side, bringing the Khostov up and firing off two more rounds. The clones hit the ground with dull thuds, but more were coming—an endless wave of silver and red, their eyes burning with rage.

She backed up, her heart pounding in her chest. There were too many. Every time she took one down, three more would appear. The room was filled with the sound of flapping wings and the metallic clinking of their talons against the floor. Neah fired round after round, each shot precise and deliberate, but it felt like she was fighting a losing battle.

The Khostov kicked back against her shoulder with every shot, the familiar recoil comforting amidst the chaos. Neah’s arms were growing tired, but she didn’t have time to think about that. The clones were relentless, and they were closing in fast.

A clone dove at her from above, its talons aimed at her face. Neah dropped to one knee, aimed, and squeezed the trigger. The shot was clean—straight through the bird’s chest. It fell to the ground in a heap, but as soon as it hit the floor, another clone appeared in its place, this one larger, faster.

## Chapter 3: The Morphing

They were adapting.

Neah cursed under her breath and moved backward, trying to create some distance between her and the horde of clones. She fired off another shot, hitting one of the clones square in the head, but it barely slowed them down. They were everywhere—swarming her from all sides, their screeches growing louder and more frenzied with every passing second.

The room was becoming a warzone. Feathers filled the air, floating like ash from a fire. Neah’s breathing was ragged, her arms shaking as she reloaded the Khostov with shaking hands. She fired again, the sound of the gunshot echoing through the cavernous building, but it felt like she was only delaying the inevitable. 

The clones were pushing her back, driving her deeper into the factory. She could feel the wall behind her now, cold and unyielding. There was nowhere left to run. Her back was against the wall, literally and figuratively. The clones closed in, their glowing eyes locked on her, their screeches growing more urgent.

Neah’s heart pounded in her ears as she fired off one last shot, taking down the nearest clone. But it didn’t matter. There were too many. They were too fast. She was out of time.

Her breath came in ragged gasps as the Khostov clicked—empty. She had no more rounds. Desperation clawed at her chest as the clones moved closer, their talons scraping against the floor, their beaks snapping hungrily. Neah braced herself, ready to fight them off with her bare hands if she had to. 

But just as the first clone lunged at her, something unexpected happened.

## Chapter 4: The Noble

A screech pierced the air, but this one was different. It wasn’t like the frenzied, malevolent cries of the clones. This screech was noble, commanding, and it froze the clones in their tracks. The room fell silent, the clones hesitating, as if unsure of what to do.

Neah’s eyes darted around the room, searching for the source of the sound. And then she saw it.

Standing in the doorway, bathed in the faint light from the hallway, was another bird. But this one was different. Its silver feathers shimmered with an ethereal glow, and its eyes—bright, piercing blue—radiated power.

It wasn’t a clone.

Neah’s breath caught in her throat as the bird stepped forward, its presence commanding the attention of every creature in the room. The clones shifted nervously, their screeches quieting as they watched the newcomer with a mixture of fear and awe.

## Chapter 5: No Retreat

The noble bird locked eyes with Neah, and for the briefest moment, she felt a sense of hope stir within her.

But she didn’t have time to dwell on it.

The clones were regrouping, and the noble bird, though powerful, was still outnumbered.

Neah didn’t know what was going to happen next, but one thing was certain—the game wasn’t over. Not yet.

And as the noble bird screeched once more, Neah felt a spark of determination ignite within her.

The fight was far from over.
