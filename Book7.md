# The Silver Bird: The Woman

## Chapter 1

The engines of the **WHIP** hummed quietly as it soared through the void of space. Inside the cockpit, Whip sat in silence, staring out into the starry abyss. His mind was restless, racing with the memory of Pithurby’s final words: *“She’s coming.”* He clenched his fist, feeling the weight of the situation bearing down on him. Whoever “she” was, Whip knew that the danger was far from over, and that Prethy, the real Prethy, was still out there, suffering at the hands of a new threat.

The ship’s AI chimed softly, breaking his thoughts.

“Approaching the target coordinates, Commander Whip,” the AI’s calm, mechanical voice said. “Shall I engage landing protocols?”

Whip leaned forward in his seat, his golden eyes narrowing. “Not yet,” he replied. “I need to scout the area first. Send out a few drones.”

“As you command.”

Small, spherical drones launched from the belly of the ship, silently gliding through space as they descended toward the surface of a desolate planet. From the cockpit, Whip monitored their feed, watching as the barren landscape unfolded before him. Jagged mountains, crumbling ruins, and blackened skies greeted the drones as they ventured further into the heart of the planet.

And then he saw it.

## Chapter 2

Nestled between the mountains was a massive fortress, dark and foreboding, with towering walls and spires that seemed to reach up into the heavens. The drones circled the fortress, scanning for weak points, but it was clear that the place was heavily fortified.

“Looks like a perfect hideout for someone up to no good,” Whip muttered to himself.

His fingers tapped the control panel, zooming in on the main entrance. A large set of double doors, engraved with strange symbols, marked the way in. The place screamed of danger. 

But Whip wasn’t afraid of danger.

He stood up, strapping his gear to his armor—his weapons, his gadgets, and most importantly, his **Ghost**, the small hovering machine that hummed softly at his side, its light flickering in sync with Whip’s pulse. The Ghost was his lifeline, capable of reviving him if death ever claimed him. In this battle, he would need that power more than ever.

Before Whip could give the command to land, the ship’s radar beeped in alarm.

“Commander Whip,” the AI said, “multiple hostile signatures detected… closing in fast.”

Whip’s eyes darted to the radar screen. Dozens—no, hundreds—of red blips were approaching from all sides. He rushed to the window and saw them: swarms of creatures, flying in formation toward his ship. 

“Clones,” he muttered under his breath. “Prethy clones…”

## Chapter 3

Just as he prepared for evasive maneuvers, the ship was rocked by a violent impact. The clones had begun to descend upon the **WHIPSTREAK**, their talons screeching against the metal hull. Whip gritted his teeth and grabbed the controls, activating the ship’s defensive shields. 

But these clones weren’t ordinary. They were fast, coordinated, and relentless. They tore at the ship’s shielding, slamming into it with such force that the hull began to buckle under the pressure.

Whip’s hands danced over the control panel, rerouting power to the shields while sending out automated turrets to fight back. Outside the ship, the sky lit up with tracer fire as the turrets opened up on the attacking swarm, shredding several clones in seconds. But for every clone that was destroyed, more appeared, seemingly endless in number.

“We’re not going to survive this,” Whip muttered. “AI, prepare for emergency landing. I’m taking this fight to the ground.”

The **WHIPSTREAK** dropped from the sky like a stone, dodging and weaving between the swarming clones as it made a rapid descent. The landing was hard, the ship shaking as it crashed into the rocky surface below. But Whip didn’t have time to care. He had a mission to complete.

With a hiss, the hatch of the ship opened, and Whip stepped out, his black armor gleaming in the faint light of the desolate planet. The moment he set foot on the ground, the clones descended upon him, a wave of shrieking, talon-filled fury.

But Whip was ready.

With a sharp motion of his hand, he called forth the power of **Strand**. Green, glowing threads erupted from his body, weaving themselves into a whip-like weapon that slashed through the air with deadly precision. As the clones attacked, Whip lashed out with the Strand, cutting through their ranks with ease. The clones fell like leaves in a storm, torn apart by the ethereal threads that obeyed Whip’s every command.

The ground was soon littered with the broken bodies of the clones, but more kept coming, pouring out of the fortress in a never-ending stream.

## Chapter 4

Whip’s movements were fluid, graceful even, as he continued to wield the Strand with deadly efficiency. The threads wrapped around the clones, tearing them apart, pulling them into the air and then slamming them back down into the ground with bone-crushing force.

But the sheer number of clones was overwhelming. For every one he killed, ten more seemed to take its place. He could feel the strain on his body, even with the Ghost healing his wounds in real-time, the fatigue was creeping in. 

Suddenly, a clone swooped in from behind, talons aimed at his head. Whip spun just in time, but not before the clone raked its claws across his chestplate, leaving deep gouges in the metal. Whip growled in pain but quickly retaliated, grabbing the clone by its neck with the Strand and flinging it into the air before it disintegrated into ash.

As the battle raged on, Whip’s attention was drawn to the massive double doors of the fortress. Something was coming.

The ground shook as the doors slowly creaked open, revealing a dark figure emerging from within. Whip’s heart raced as the figure stepped into the light—it was a woman, her face concealed by a hood, her hands glowing with dark energy.

Whip narrowed his eyes. “So, you’re the one pulling the strings.”

## Chapter 5

The woman smiled beneath her hood, her eyes glowing with malevolence. “You’re too late, Whip. The real Prethy is mine… and soon, so will everything else.”

Before Whip could respond, the woman raised her hand, and the ground beneath him erupted in a flurry of black tendrils. Whip leaped back, narrowly avoiding being caught in the snare, but the woman wasn’t done.

With a flick of her wrist, she sent a wave of dark energy hurtling toward Whip. He raised his arm, summoning the power of Strand to counter the attack, but the force of the blast sent him flying backward, slamming him into the rocky wall of the mountain.

Pain shot through his body as he collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath. His Ghost hovered over him, quickly healing his wounds, but the battle had taken its toll.

The woman approached slowly, her dark magic swirling around her like a storm. “You can’t stop what’s coming,” she said, her voice cold and mocking. “The real Prethy is just the beginning. Soon, the entire universe will bend to my will.”

Whip struggled to his feet, his body shaking from exhaustion. “I’ve heard that before,” he said, his voice hoarse. “And I’ve stopped every one of you.”

The woman laughed, a chilling sound that echoed through the mountains. “This time, you won’t be so lucky.”

## Chapter 6

With a snap of her fingers, the remaining clones surged forward, attacking Whip with renewed ferocity. He fought back with everything he had, but his strength was fading fast. His Ghost continued to heal him, but the relentless assault of the clones was overwhelming.

As Whip struggled to hold his ground, the woman’s voice echoed through the air. “You’re too late, Whip. The real Prethy will suffer for all eternity… and there’s nothing you can do to save her.”

And then, just as Whip thought all hope was lost, a sound pierced the chaos—a soft, faint cry that echoed through the wind.

Whip froze, his eyes widening in disbelief.

It was Prethy.

The real Prethy’s voice… calling out for help.

## Chapter 7

The woman’s smile faltered, just for a moment, as the cry of the real Prethy echoed through the mountains once again, louder this time. Whip’s heart raced. She was still alive.

He gritted his teeth, summoning the last of his strength as he lashed out with the power of Strand, cutting through the remaining clones with a savage fury.

“I’m coming for you, Prethy,” he muttered under his breath, his eyes filled with determination.

But as he fought his way forward, the woman’s dark laughter filled the air once more, her voice dripping with malice.

“You may find her,” she said, her voice echoing in the darkness, “but by then… it will be far too late.”

And with that, the ground beneath Whip’s feet gave way, plunging him into a dark, endless abyss.

The last thing he saw before the darkness swallowed him was the woman’s cold, mocking smile.

## Chapter 8

In a cold, dimly lit chamber deep within the fortress, the real Prethy hung in chains, her once-bright feathers dulled by pain and suffering. The woman stood before her, smiling cruelly as she ran her fingers along Prethy’s trembling form.
