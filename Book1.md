# The Silver Bird: The Faceoff

## Chapter 1: The Inquiry

As Neah rummaged through the box, she stopped at the sight of the picture. She picked it up gently, and thought wistfully of the time the picture was taken. It was taken by her sisters, and it was of Neah and her pet bird, Prethy. She flipped it over and read the large, child-like handwriting on the back. 

Dear, Miss Neah

I hope this picture reminds you of the fun we had.

Luv, Prethy

Neah sighed. She did remember. She remembered that she and her sisters had to leave, too. She sighed again. She gently placed the picture on top of the box, and closed the box. A screeching whistle shot from the phone on her desk. She sighed, very loudly this time. Probably another call for a sick animal, she thought. "This is Neah, from Moses Vets, speaking. Who am I speaking to, and what is the issue with the animal?", she said into the phone. "I'm not calling about a sick animal, Neah," said a voice from the phone. "Who is this?" asked Neah, trying to place the voice. "Allow me to introduce myself, " the voice said snobbily, "I'm Dr. Thena."
"Dr. Thena? I don't think I've heard of you."
"What? Impossible! I own one of the biggest precious metal manufacturers in the world!"
"Well, I've got hardly anything to do with metals. So, Dr. Thena, what is it you want?"
"Well, " Thena replied, "I've heard that you know of a mystical bird calle---"
"Argentis Stellaves," Neah said softly, "The Silver Bird. Yes, I know of the bird. Do you want information about the creature?"
"No," Thena replied, curtly. Neah didn't like this woman. Thena had an air of pride around her, and Neah, in contrast, was a quiet young woman, who didn't want anything with the likes of her. Still, the manners in Neah told her to ignore it, and entertain Thena, with Neah's deep knowledge in all things animal. "Then?" Neah asked, "Why are you bothering me?"
"Look, " said Thena, deeply offended, "I don't know exactly who you are, and you've got to understand that next to me, you're nobody. So, I've heard YOU know how to find it."
"Yes, I do."
"Then, can you find it for me? As for money, name your price."
"No."
"What?!" said Thena, incredulous, "Impossible! No one can resist so much money!"
"Just no. That's it."
"I'll find someone better than you," sneered Thena, "Just you wait."
The call ended abruptly, and Neah slammed the phone on the desk, angry.

## Chapter 2: The Nightmare

At this Thena. Neah had no clue, whatsoever, about Thena, and Neah was determined to find out. Before searching her up, she glanced at her watch. The watch read 6:00 PM. Great, she thought. Neah had a strict sleeping schedule, which she always tried to adhere to. She walked into the bathroom and sneezed toothpaste on her brush. She thought of the first time she brushed Prethy's beak with a soft cloth and some drinking water. 

Hold still, she remembered saying. Prethy was an energetic little chick, even as a baby chick and kept wiggling all through the process, splashing water here and there and on the book of Riya, her elder sister. It was playing out in her mind as clearly as if it had been yesterday. "Hey!", she had said slamming the book closed. "What'd you do that for, Prethy?" Riya asked. Prethy's voice was not very strong then, but she, angry, squeaked back!


Neah rinsed her toothbrush, the memory of Prethy still vivid in her mind. Prethy was not just any bird; she had been something of a miracle—a rare and special creature, even as a chick. The bond they had shared was deep, and Neah still couldn't fully explain why she felt such an unusual connection with her. After all these years, the photograph reminded her of simpler times, but now her life was far from simple. She felt a gnawing unease. Thena’s abrupt phone call had disturbed more than just her evening routine.

As she climbed into bed, thoughts of Argentis Stellaves flooded her mind. The Silver Bird, believed to be a myth by many, was known to have mystical powers. Prethy had been an extraordinary bird, not exactly the legendary Argentis Stellaves, but special nonetheless. Neah knew that, and she had her suspicions that perhaps Thena did too. Why else would someone so powerful call her, out of all people? Still, the last thing Neah wanted was for Prethy, or her memory, to fall into the hands of someone like Thena.

Her sleep was restless. In the early hours of the morning, she awoke suddenly, her heart racing. In her dream, Prethy had been flying towards her, but her silver feathers had darkened, and her usually bright eyes had turned an unsettling red. The bird had called out to her, its voice deeper, almost distorted. “Find me,” it had said.

Neah sat up, her pulse still racing. The dream left her uneasy, though she couldn't make sense of it. She hadn't thought of Prethy in this way before. But then again, she had been avoiding thoughts of her since that day—since Prethy had vanished.

## Chapter 3: The Reunion

Unable to shake the feeling, Neah decided she couldn't let Thena’s call go unanswered. She needed to know why Thena had sought her out and why now, after so many years, someone had taken an interest in the Silver Bird. Was there a connection to Prethy’s disappearance? Neah quickly dressed and powered on her computer. She searched for Dr. Thena, and immediately a slew of articles appeared, chronicling her rise to wealth and power.

Thena was indeed as arrogant as her phone call had suggested. Her company, one of the largest producers of precious metals, had recently been involved in rumors of unethical practices—specifically, the illegal extraction of rare and potentially mystical materials.

The more Neah read, the more uneasy she became. Dr. Thena had a particular obsession with artifacts and creatures believed to possess unique powers. As Neah scrolled through images, she stopped at one. It was a photo of Thena with a large bird—silver-feathered, but not quite like Prethy. It was similar enough, though, to raise the hairs on the back of Neah's neck. Was Thena hunting down rare birds, hoping one of them would be the legendary Argentis Stellaves? And could Prethy have been one of her targets?

Determined to get answers, Neah gathered her things and left her house in haste. The early morning light barely filtered through the trees as she drove towards her destination: an old aviary where she and her sisters had first found Prethy as a chick. If there were any clues about Prethy’s true nature, they would be there.

As Neah approached the aviary, a strange sensation filled the air, an unsettling stillness that made her heart race. She had barely stepped inside when a familiar screech echoed through the corridors. Her blood ran cold. That sound—it was Prethy.

## Chapter 4: The Realization

But something was wrong. It didn’t sound like the sweet, playful bird she remembered.

Following the noise, Neah made her way deeper into the aviary. The light flickered as she walked, casting eerie shadows on the old walls. Finally, she found herself standing in front of a large cage, and there, perched inside, was Prethy—or what looked like her. The bird’s feathers, once a shimmering silver, were now a dull, metallic gray. Her eyes were glowing red, just like in Neah's dream.

"Prethy?" Neah whispered, stepping closer. The bird screeched again, a sound that sent shivers down her spine. It was unmistakably Prethy, but something had changed. There was a darkness around her now, something unnatural.

Suddenly, the door to the aviary creaked open, and Thena stepped inside, her lips curled into a smug smile. "I see you found her," she said, her voice dripping with satisfaction. "I told you I’d find someone better."

Neah’s heart pounded in her chest. "What did you do to her?"

Thena stepped closer to the cage, her eyes gleaming with malice. "I didn’t do anything. Prethy was always special, you just never realized how much. I simply... unlocked her true potential."

Neah’s stomach twisted in horror. "You manipulated her!"

Thena laughed, a cold, hollow sound. "Prethy always had a connection to the Argentis Stellaves, didn’t she? I merely helped her tap into that power. Now, she’s more powerful than ever, but also... well, let’s just say she’s not the same little bird you remember."

Prethy’s red eyes fixed on Neah, and for a moment, the bird seemed to recognize her. But then, with a violent screech, she lunged at the bars of the cage, her beak snapping viciously.

"You see," Thena continued, "she's mine now. And soon, she’ll lead me to the Argentis Stellaves. With their power, I’ll be unstoppable."

Neah’s mind raced. She couldn’t let Thena succeed, and more importantly, she couldn’t let Prethy remain under her control. She had to do something—but what?

## Chapter 5: The Inevitable

In that moment, a realization struck Neah. The connection she shared with Prethy was deeper than anything Thena could understand. Maybe there was still a way to save her.

"Prethy," Neah whispered, stepping closer to the cage. "Remember me? It’s Neah. I’m here."

The bird’s eyes flickered, but the darkness remained.

Thena rolled her eyes. "Oh, please. She’s beyond saving. Just give it up."

But Neah wasn’t listening. Slowly, she reached into her pocket and pulled out the photograph—the one of her and Prethy. "Remember this?" she said softly, holding it up to the cage. "This was us. We were happy. You were free."

For a brief moment, Prethy hesitated, her aggressive movements slowing. The red glow in her eyes dimmed ever so slightly. Neah felt a glimmer of hope.

But then, with a deafening screech, Prethy lashed out again, slamming into the bars of the cage with terrifying force. The red glow intensified, and Neah knew—Prethy was lost. Whatever Thena had done to her, it was irreversible.

Tears welled up in Neah’s eyes as she realized what she had to do. Slowly, she reached into her bag and pulled out a small tranquilizer gun, something she had always carried for emergencies. But this wasn’t just any tranquilizer—it was strong enough to stop a creature like Prethy permanently.

"I’m sorry," Neah whispered, her voice breaking. "I love you."

With a heavy heart, Neah aimed the gun and fired. Prethy screeched one final time, her wings flapping wildly before she collapsed to the floor of the cage. The red glow in her eyes faded, and for just a moment, Neah thought she saw the old Prethy—the bird she had loved so much.

Thena’s smug expression twisted into anger. "You fool!" she hissed. "You’ve ruined everything!"

But Neah didn’t care. She had done what she had to. Prethy was free now, free from Thena’s control, free from the darkness.

As she walked away from the aviary, the tears finally fell, but Neah knew one thing for certain—Prethy was at peace, and Thena would never have her power.
